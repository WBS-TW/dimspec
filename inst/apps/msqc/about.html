<h4>Welcome to the NIST database for identification of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by non-targeted analysis (NTA) using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRAMS).</h4>
<p>The goal of this project is to improve access to and utility of analytical data for the confidence dicovery, identification, and source-attribution of PFAS in environmental matrics.</p>
<br>
<p>The quality control check tool for the PFAS Mass Spectral database is for the evaluation of mass spectral data for general quality and for the generation of import files that can be directly incorporated into the database.</p>
<p>In order to use this application, the following must be done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raw data files must be converted to mzML (link here for directions)</li>
  <li>Sample JSON files for each raw data file must be generated, using the <a href="data/NTA Method Reporting Tool.xlsm">Method Reporting Tool</a></li>
</ul>
