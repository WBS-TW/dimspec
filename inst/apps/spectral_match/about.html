<h3>Welcome to the NIST database for identification of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by non-targeted analysis (NTA) using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRAMS).</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to improve access to and utility of analytical data for the confidence dicovery, identification, and source-attribution of PFAS in environmental matrics.</p>
<p>As part of that, the Mass Spectral Match (MS Match) application is for matching user data (in mzML format) against the current mass spectral database for matching analytes and fragmentation patterns. Full usage instructions can be found in the <a href="https://usnistgov.github.io/dimspec">DIMSpec User Guide</a>, or in the <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/dimspec/-/blob/master/vignettes/quick_apps.Rmd">quick guide for web applications</a>.</p>

<p>This project was funded in part by the Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program grant <a href = "https://www.serdp-estcp.org/Program-Areas/Environmental-Restoration/Risk-Assessment/ER20-1056">ER20-1056</a>. The application you are using now was developed by researchers in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/mml/csd">Chemical Sciences Division</a> of the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/mml">Material Measurement Laboratory</a> at the US <a href="https://www.nist.gov">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>.
