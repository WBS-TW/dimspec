<h3>Welcome</h3>
<h4>Welcome to the NIST database for identification of perfluoroalkly substances (PFAS) by non-targeted analysis (NTA) using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRAMS).</h4>
<p>The goal of this project is to improve access to and utility of analytical data for the confidence dicovery, identification, and source-attribution of PFAS in environmental matrics.</p>
<p>Use of spectral libraries is essential to the success of NTA protocols to identify unknown per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in environmental samples. Current spectral libraries are limited due to the lack of standard data formats and database structures, which limits interoperability between analytical laboratories and even different platforms within laboratories. The main objective of this project is to develop a data analytics infrastructure to contain PFAS mass spectral information and metadata of detected PFAS. With an open database structure, analytical laboratories will be able to include this database in their NTA workflow to identify unknown PFAS.</p>
