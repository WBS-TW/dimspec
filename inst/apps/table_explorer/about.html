<h3>About the DIMSpec Table Explorer Application</h3>
<p>This web application was written in <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shiny/">Shiny</a> to facilitate visual exploration of the DIMSpec database schema. It serves as proof-of-concept for the database/API/shiny approach and was used as the basic skeleton of the template app that ships with the project.</p>
<p>Table Explorer is a simple entity viewer for the attached database. Combining the SQL comment decoration convention in DIMSpec (see the DIMSpec User Guide) and direct reading of entity definitions from the database allows for R to expose a wealth of information about the underlying schema and quickly change which entity is being viewed. A navigation bar on the left controls the current page being viewed; collapse the bar using the “hamburger” icon (≡) at the top next to the NIST logo.</p>
<p>There is only one page for interactive content, named “Table Viewer”. Click the drop down box to change the database table or view being displayed. Immediately below the selection box is a text narrative that includes the entity-level comment describing the selected entity, which tables the entity references or is referenced by, and a list of the columns in that entity with their type, requirement, and the column-level comment describing it. A small data viewer for the selected entity (powered by the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT package</a>) is included to the right. This viewer fully supports column level filtration and sorting, multiple length views, pagination, and search.</p>
<p>Select the "Entity Relationship Diagram" page to view a snapshot of the entity relationship diagram (ERD) for the DIMSpec schema. Right click it to open in a new tab to see it in full resolution. The ERD is organized into "nodes" which are more fully described in the DIMSpec User Guide.</p>
