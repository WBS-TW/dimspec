<h3>Welcome to the NIST database for identification of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by non-targeted analysis (NTA) using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to improve access to and utility of analytical data for the confident discovery, identification, and source-attribution of PFAS in environmental matrics. It is powered by the data infrastructure for mass spectrometry (DIMSpec) project and includes curated HRMS spectral data (MS1 and MS2) for a collection of PFAS.</p>
<p>As part of that, the Mass Spectral Match (MSMatch) application is for matching user data (in mzML format) against this mass spectral database for matching analytes and fragmentation patterns. Full usage instructions can be found in the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/dimspec/docs" target="_blank">DIMSpec User Guide</a>, or in the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/dimspec/docs/quick_apps.pdf" target="_blank">quick guide for web applications</a>.</p>
