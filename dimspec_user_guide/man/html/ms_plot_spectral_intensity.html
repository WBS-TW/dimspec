<h2>Create a spectral intensity plot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Often it is useful to get an overview of mass-to-charge intensity across the
scanning time of a peak. Typically this is done with individual traces in the
peak fashion, but large peaks can often mask smaller ones, or wash out lower
intensity signals. Use this to plot m/z as dependent upon scan time with
intensity shown by color and size. It is intended as a complement to
[ms_plot_peak] and may be called at the same levels of granularity, generally
greater so than [ms_plot_peak] which is more of an overview.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ms_plot_spectral_intensity(
  data,
  intensity_mz_resolution = 5,
  intensity_drop_ratio = 0,
  intensity_facet_by = NULL,
  intensity_plot_resolution = c("spectra", "peak"),
  include_method = TRUE,
  db_conn = con
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>tibble or pointer with data to plot, either at the peak level, in
which case &quot;base_ion&quot; must be present, or at the spectral level, in which
case &quot;intensity&quot; must be present</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>intensity_mz_resolution</code></td>
<td>
<p>INT scalar mass to charge ratio tolerance to
group peaks, with at minimum columns for intensity (as &quot;base_int&quot; or
&quot;intensity&quot;), ion m/z value (as &quot;base_ion&quot; or &quot;mz&quot;), and scan time (as
&quot;scantime&quot;) - (default: 5)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>intensity_drop_ratio</code></td>
<td>
<p>NUM scalar threshold of the maximum intensity
below which traces will be dropped (default: 0 returns all); if &gt; 1 the
inversion will be used (1e5 -&gt; 1e-5)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>intensity_facet_by</code></td>
<td>
<p>CHR scalar of a column name in 'data' by which to
facet the resulting plot (default: NULL)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>db_conn</code></td>
<td>
<p>database connection (default: con) which must be live to pull
sample and compound identification information</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>object of classes 'gg' and 'ggplot'
