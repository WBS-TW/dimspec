<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_type</code></td>

<p>CHR scalar of the plot type to draw, must be one of &quot;line&quot;,

resulting plot (default: &quot;ms_n&quot;)</p>

<td>
<p>INT scalar mass to charge ratio tolerance to group
peaks, with at minimum columns for intensity (as &quot;base_int&quot;), ion m/z value

resolution)</p>

<p>NUM scalar threshold of the maximum intensity below
which traces will be dropped (default: 1e-2 means any trace with a maximum

<td>
<p>LGL scalar on whether to use the [ggrepel] package
to space out m/z labels in the plot (default: TRUE). If [ggrepel] is not

points; passed to [ggrepel::geom_text_repel] as segment.color (only a
single color is supported; default: &quot;grey50&quot;)
</p>

\item<p>patchwork_designthe layout of the final plot see [patchwork::design]
</p>
\item<p>as_individual_plotsLGL scalar of whether to return the plots
individually in a list (set TRUE) or as a patchwork plot (default: FALSE)
</p>
\item<p>db_conndatabase connection (default: con) which must be live to pull
sample and compound identification information


object of classes 'gg' and 'ggplot', as a patchwork unless
'as_individual_plots' is TRUE


Call this function to generate a combined plot from [ms_plot_peak],
[ms_plot_spectra], and [ms_plot_spectral_intensity] using the [patchwork]
package, which must be installed. All arguments will be passed directly to
the underlying functions to provide flexibility in the final display. The
default settings match those of the called plotting functions, and the output
can be further manipulated with the patchwork package.


Requires a live connection to the database to pull all plots for a
given peak_id.
</p>
<p>Defaults are as for called functions
