# (PART\*) Shiny Web Applications {-}

# Table Explorer  {#table-explorer-home .unnumbered}

To facilitate visual exploration of the DIMSpec database schema, a web application was written in Shiny. It served as proof-of-concept for the database/API/shiny approach and was used as the basic skeleton of the template app that ships with the project.

Table Explorer is a simple entity viewer for the attached database. Combining the comment decorations in DIMSpec and reading of entity definitions from the database (see [Inspecting Database Properties](#inspecting-database-properties)) allows for R to expose a wealth of information about the underlying schema and quickly change which entity is being viewed. See [Shiny Applications](#shiny-applications) for details of how to launch this app, but the easiest method is after the `compliance.R` script has been executed, use `start_app("table_explorer")` to launch it in your preferred browser.

## Table Viewer {#table-explorer-table-viewer .unnumbered}

There is only one page for interactive content, named "Table Viewer" ([Figure 1](#fig03-01)). A navigation bar on the left controls the current page being viewed; collapse the bar using the “hamburger” icon (three short horizontal lines stacked on top of one another) at the top next to the NIST logo. Click the drop down box ([Figure 2 - left](#fig03-02)) to change the database table or view being displayed. This will update the definition narrative immediately below the selection box ([Figure 2 - right](#fig03-02)) and display the contents of that table ([Figure 3](#fig03-03)).
