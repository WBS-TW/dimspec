Description:	Logging node for NIST high-resolution-accurate-mass spectrometric database for 
				non-target analysis (HRAM-NTA).
Status:			Development version
LastUpdate:		2021-06-15
Support:		For information or support, contact the development team at
					- NIST PFAS Program	PFAS@nist.gov
					- Jared M. Ragland	jared.ragland@nist.gov	*author
					- Benjamin J. Place	benjamin.place@nist.gov
Dependencies:	sqlite3
Usage:			Run this script from the terminal to create a sketch of the SQLite database. It is 
				recommended to run from the project directory as
				
					sqlite3 nist_nta_dev.sqlite
					.read config/sql_nodes/logging.sql
				
Details:		Node build files are located in the "config/sql_nodes" directory and serve to allow
				for modular construction and reuse. Local paths will need to be referenced 
				appropriately, which may require modifications to scripts referencing this script.
				
				The comment "magicsplit" is present to provide a hook for external processing,
				allowing for direct building via R or Python when the CLI is unavailable. 
				
				Log triggers should be set up separately and only after other tables and views have
				been created. This should be called last during the build if any autologging is 
				desired.
