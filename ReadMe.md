# Database Infrastructure for Mass Spectrometry (DIMSpec)

## About

Welcome to the home page of the Database Infrastructure for Mass Spectrometry project.

## Motivation

## Features

## Getting Started

Basic requirements to get the most out of DIMSpec include (but may not be limited to):
- R >= v4.1
  - packages will be loaded as part of the project installation
- Java (bit architecture matching that of R)
- MSConvert >= 3.0.21050 (from ProteoWizard)
- SQLite >= v3.32.0
- Mini/Anaconda w/ Python >= 3.8 (if you do not have this, R can load it for you as part of project installation)

## Guides and Vignettes

For a full description of the project and its different aspects, please see the [DIMSpec User Guide]().

A series of Quick Guides have been made available focusing on various aspects of the project.
