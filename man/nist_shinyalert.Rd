\arguments{
\item{title}{The title of the modal.}

\item{type}{The type of the modal. There are 4 built-in types which will show
a corresponding icon: \code{"warning"}, \code{"error"}, \code{"success"} and
\code{"info"}. You can also set \code{type="input"} to get a prompt
in the modal where the user can enter a response. By default, the modal has
no type.}

Shiny inputs and outputs). If using Shiny tags, then you must also set \code{html=TRUE}.}

\item{className}{A custom CSS class name for the modal's container.}

\item{html}{If \code{TRUE}, the content of the title and text will not be
escaped. By default, the content in the title and text are escaped, so any
HTML tags will not render as HTML.}

clicking outside it.}

\item{immediate}{If \code{TRUE}, close any previously opened alerts and display
the current one immediately.}
