<h2>Match multiple values in a database table</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Complex queries are sometimes necessary to match against multiple varied
conditions across multiple items in a list or data frame. Call this function
to apply vectorization to all items in 'match_criteria' and create a fully
qualified SQL expression using [clause_where] and execute that query against
the database connection in 'db_conn'. Speed is not optimized during the call
to clause where as each clause is built independently and joined together
with &quot;OR&quot; statements.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
dataframe_match(
  match_criteria,
  table_names,
  and_or = "AND",
  db_conn = con,
  log_ns = "db"
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>match_criteria</code></td>
<td>
<p>LIST of matching criteria with names matching columns
against which to apply. In the simplest case, a direct value is given to
the name (e.g. 'list(last_name = &quot;Smith&quot;)') for single matches. All match
criteria must be their own list item. Values can also be provided as a
nested list for more complicated WHERE clauses with names 'values',
'exclude', and 'like' that will be recognized. 'values' should be the
actual search criteria, and if a vector of length greater than one is
specified, the WHERE clause becomes an IN clause. 'exclude' (LGL scalar)
determines whether to apply the NOT operator. 'like' (LGL scalar)
determines whether this is an equality, list, or similarity. To reverse the
example above by issuing a NOT statement, use 'list(last_name = list(values
= &quot;Smith&quot;, exclude = TRUE))', or to look for all records LIKE (or NOT LIKE)
&quot;Smith&quot;, set this as 'list(last_name = list(values = &quot;Smith&quot;, exclude =
FALSE, like = TRUE))'</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>table_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>CHR vector of tables to search</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>and_or</code></td>
<td>
<p>LGL scalar of whether to use &quot;AND&quot; or &quot;OR&quot; for multiple
criteria, which will be used to combine them all. More complicated WHERE
clauses (including a mixture of AND and OR usage) should be built directly.
(default: &quot;OR&quot;)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>db_conn</code></td>
<td>
<p>connection object (default: con)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>log_ns</code></td>
<td>
<p>CHR scalar of the logging namespace to use during execution
(default: &quot;db&quot;)</p>
</td></tr>
