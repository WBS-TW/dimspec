\description{
This input validation check uses [tools::file_ext] to ensure that files
uploaded to [shiny::fileInput] are among the acceptable file formats. Users
may sometimes wish to load a file outside the "accepts" format list by
manually changing it during the upload process. If they are not, a
[nist_shinyalert] modal is displayed prompting the user to upload a file in
one of the requested formats.
