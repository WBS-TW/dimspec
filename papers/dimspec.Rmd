# Abstract

# Introduction

The use of mass spectral libraries is essential for the confident identification and reporting of analytical chemistry measureands, whether they be environmental contaminants or novel compounds. Toward that end the US National Institute of Standards and Technology provides a series of mass spectral libraries in use at analytical research, development, and contracting laboratories throughout the US. Contrasting with targeted methods, where analyte identities and their mass spectral properties are known a priori are non-targeted analysis (NTA) methods, where compound identity is unknown. Even when analytes are "known" (i.e. their mass spectral properties have been measured and reported in the literature) different extraction and measurement methods may show slight differences in mass spectral properties. The gold standard for matching mass spectra is use of a library of mass spectral standards, yet such standards are available only for a small fraction of "known" analytes.

For analyte classes with decades of analytical study (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls, vitamins, etc.), such "known" analytes are generally covered well by analytical standards. This is not the case for analyte classes of more recent interest (e.g. per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances). Research needs generally run ahead of standards availability; new paradigms such as NTA are therefore necessary to assess analyte identity and properties by identifying mass spectral patterns of both the analyte itself and its fragmentation patterns. Analytes characterized in this fashion can then be published for identification in other methods and laboratories. As of 2023, the process of distributing such data still lags behind many research needs. Several efforts to address this are beginning to emerge [@TODO cite a bunch of stuff], but few achieve the effort of being reusable and interoperable.

Here, we describe a tool set produced by the NIST Chemical Sciences Division to capture data from high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) spectrometry experiments in a formal manner. The Database Infrastructure for Mass Spectrometry (DIMSpec) project allows for the creation of portable databases that tie experimental mass spectra with sample and methodological metadata. DIMSpec uses SQLite, a common portable database engine, for data storage and a collected set of data management and NTA tools written in the R language. This includes the ability to rapidly iterate and launch new databases supporting a particular project, analyte class of interest, or research program, and results in a single database file that may be shared widely without restriction on resulting use. When used with the associated toolkit, researchers can leverage NTA tools in active use at NIST for quality assurance and identification of unknown analytes using current state-of-the-science techniques, and to record their data and contribute back to the research community. Only open access frameworks were used in the development of DIMSpec.

We believe strongly in the public availability of and open access to research data and hope that the tool set described here can be of use in moving the NTA research community toward practices that will facilitate sharing and reuse of such data, moving analytical chemistry data practices for NTA toward the FAIR principles [@TODO cite].

# Content and Usage of DIMSpec Databases

A full user guide for the DIMSpec project is hosted as a webbook on GitHub [@TODO cite]; this will be updated as the project develops and serves as the definitive "how to" on using DIMSpec databases. Information in the following sections is provided as a summary of that user guide to provide context for this publication. Data preprocessing steps for DIMSpec databases includes three steps as provided.

For all uses, conversion of raw data files produced by a mass spectrometer into the mzML format ([@deutsch_mass_2010]) using Proteowizard's msConvert software ([@adusumilli_data_2017]) is necessary. That software supports conversion of most mass spectrometer vendor formats. Specific parameters are required during conversion (details are provided in the user guide or as a [vignette](@TODO%20github%20link)); these include (1) Filter: Threshold peak filter, (2) Threshold type: absolute, (3) Orientation: most intense, (4) Value: 1, (5) Filter: Peak picking, (6) Algorithm: vendor, and (7) MS levels: 1-2.

While creating submissions for a DIMSpec database (in order to facilitate batch population), a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel workbook, called the Non-Targeted Analysis Method Reporting Tool (NTA-MRT), is used for the systematic collection of sample, method, and compound information related to chemicals identified in a sample. The most up-to-date version of NTA-MRT is publicly available at [GitHub](https://github.com/usnistgov/NISTPFAS/tree/main/methodreportingtool); instructions for completing it are contained within the tool itself. Using controlled vocabulary and a defined workflow, the NTA-MRT will produce files in javascript object notation (JSON) format describing features of interest in a data file.

Finally, mzML and JSON files are used with the [Mass Spectra Quality Control (MSQC)](#mass-spectra-quality-control-msqc) application (provided with the project) to perform quality assurance checks and produce files (also in JSON format) for import into an existing DIMSpec database. If data are submitted to an existing project controlled by NIST, this last step is not required and will be performed during evaluation of the data submission.

As SQLite files, DIMSpec databases may be read or populated by any controlled workflow; the steps described above are required for existing import routines to function as designed. The MSQC application is one of three web applications included in the project to facilitate use through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). At this time, DIMSpec does not include a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) GUI application; direct manipulation of the database can be accomplished through your choice of database interface software. Additionally, as DIMSpec is intended to be a portable and reusable database, no publicly availables interfaces are hosted by NIST at this time; the project is intended to be downloaded by each user to accommodate their use cases.

## Database Schema

With the goal of providing a reusable and portable database, any number of DIMSpec databases may be created as project needs dictate. To that end, schema are defined in a series of scripts in standard query language (SQL) and structured in a series of "nodes" with an SQL script determining which are to be included when new databases are built. If the sqlite3 CLI is not available a "fallback" build exists that will build directly from a much larger source file.

Each node file defines the tables and views necessary to store and serve data for a set of conceptually related entities in the database. An opinionated comment decoration scheme is used to facilitate translatability to R. See the DIMSpec User Guide for more details on the comment decorations and how these are read and interpreted by R during database communication functions. These allow for R to interpret the schema and provide programmatic access for certain operations. A data dictionary is available in supplemental materials as a JSON file describing all tables and views in the current schema.

Currently there are X nodes in the database

## Toolkit

The DIMSpec toolkit [^1] has been tested on both Windows 10 and a virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.0.4.3 LTS 64-bit[^2] platforms and should run on any system able to install R, Python, SQLite3, and a web browser [^3], though installation details may vary by operating systems. Follow the instructions for each requirement on the target operating system. The only hard requirement is [R v4.1+](https://cran.r-project.org/)[@R-base] and many packages (which will be installed automatically), as well as [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) for Windows users; as the project is oriented as a an RStudio project, it is strongly recommended that users also install the RStudio [@RStudio] integrated development environment for ease of use. Other strongly recommended software installs are [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.com/download.html) and its command line interface [CLI](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html) to simplify aspects of reuse, a lightweight database interface such as [DBeaver Lite](https://dbeaver.com/download/lite/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for project version control; for best results the git and sqlite3 CLI executables must be available via PATH. If chemometric support is desired, the DIMSpec project includes an integration of the rdkit [@RDKit] python library; it is recommended but not required to install python 3.9+ and a package manager such as miniconda, though the installation routine from within R will install these automatically if necessary. Refer to relevant sections of the full user guide if the machine using DIMSpec already has installations of python for other purposes as setups may vary widely. DIMSpec ships with a populated database of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) for demonstration.

### R

To get started seting up the project toolkit, download it from [GitHub](@TODO%20link).

### Chemometrics

### Application Programming Interface

### Web Applications

For many use cases involving simply using a DIMSpec database, the majority of their interaction with the will be through graphical user interfaces providing access to the underlying data and functionality. This simplifies their experience and increases the value of the project. Web applications in the DIMSpec project are powered by the [\`shiny\`] package [@R-shiny]. Provided applications communicate with the database through the application programming interface (API) provided by the [\`plumber\`] package [@R-plumber], though others can be readily developed that connect directly to the database.

Three web applications are included in the DIMSpec project when it is installed. Once the compliance script has been executed, launch any of them using the provided `start_app("X")` function where `"X"` is the name of the application. Environment resolution scripts also allow for easily launching from a terminal opened at the project directory using `shiny::runApp("X")` where `"X"` is the path to the application, nominally located inside the `/inst/apps` directory.

#### Table Explorer

To facilitate visual exploration of the database, the Table Explorer application provides information about tables and views in an intuitive interface and details not only their contents but the entity definition and relationships to other entities in a human-readable format. It includes only two screens, one ("Table Viewer") to preview data available and to view structural information for the selected entity, and another to view a high-resolution picture of the entity relationship diagram that can be downloaded or examined in a separate browser tab with the right-click context menu option to open an image in a new tab. Launch it using either `start_app("table_explorer")` or `shiny::runApp(here::here("inst", "apps", "table_explorer")`. The interface is extremely simple ([Figure 1](#figure-table-explorer-home)); change the selected entity using the drop down menu to update.

#### Mass Spectra Quality Control (MSQC) {#mass-spectra-quality-control-msqc}

Due to the nature of NTA project, it is recommended to perform quality control checks of experimental data prior to populating data. The Mass Spectral Quality Control application was developed to facilitate application of quality control metrics developed by NIST, and will create DIMSpec compliant import files in JSON format that meet all requirements by combining the results of experimental data (in mzML format), and the annotations provided by the NTA-MRT.

It applies seven data quality checks ensuring that: (1) the reported precursor ion(s) are within reported mass accuracy bounds given an ideal ion mass for each identified analyte, (2) the MS1 isotopic pattern matches that of a calculated isotopic pattern above an acceptability threshold, (3) precursor ion(s) are present in the provided data file, (4) annotated fragments are present in the provided data file, (5) the mass accuracy of annotated fragments are within reported instrumental error ranges given an ideal ion mass for each identified fragment, (6) the reported elemental formulas for each annotated fragment are a valid subset of the identified analyte, and (7) if there is a SMILES structure provided that it reasonably the elemental formula of the annotated fragment. Additionally, parameters for an optimized uncertainty mass spectrum are calculated for import which facilitates searching of unknown data against recorded fragmentation patterns.

Thresholds for each of these checks

#### Mass Spectral Match (MSMatch)

# Results

```{r echo=FALSE}
sample_classes <- dbReadTable(con, "view_samples") |> count(sample_class_id)
ms_spectra <- dbGetQuery(con, "select count(*) from ms_data")
peaks <- dbReadTable(con, "peaks")
```

## Included data for PFAS

In its distributed form, the DIMSpec project includes a database populated with empirical high resolution tandem mass spectrometry experiments for per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances. Samples from analytical standards (n = `r sample_classes$n[sample_classes$sample_class_id == "analytical standard"]`), aqueous film-forming foam solutions (n = `r sample_classes$n[sample_classes$sample_class_id == "aqueous film-forming form (AFFF)"]`), and commercial formulations (n = `r sample_classes$n[sample_classes$sample_class_id == "commercial formulation"]`) are represented. From these, `r scales::comma(ms_spectra[[1]])` HRAM spectra of high quality describing `r nrow(peaks)` were recorded using a [@TODO Ben do you have an analytical method brief we can drop in here?].

# Conclusion

In this paper we present the DIMSpec project, a freely available and open source toolkit for rapid iteration of databases supporting data storage and retrieval for non-targeted analysis of high resolution mass spectrometry data. Included in the project repository is a database of more than 24,000 high quality HRAMS spectra for per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances. The toolkit and any DIMSpec databases are easily extensible and can be customized for a wide variety of use cases. While DIMSpec is not intended to support quantitative measurements at this time, as data storage is focused specifically around chromatographic peaks it could easily do so by adding a table referencing the peak objects with columns storing desireable quantitative measures such as integrated intensity, calculated mass fraction, and units.
