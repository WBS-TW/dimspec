These tools operate across the analysis pipeline doing everything from assessing quality control to matching peptides to spectra to quantification. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these tools are not able to operate directly on the proprietary formats generated by the diverse mass spectrometers. Consequently, the first step in many protocols is the conversion of data from vendor-specific binary files to open-format files. This protocol details the use of ProteoWizard's msConvert and msConvertGUI software for this conversion, taking format features, coding options, and vendor particularities into account. We specifically describe the various options available when doing conversions and the implications of each option.},

	abstract = {Mass spectrometry is an important technique for analyzing proteins and other biomolecular compounds in biological samples. Each of the vendors of these mass spectrometers uses a different proprietary binary output file format, which has hindered data sharing and the development of open source software for downstream analysis. The solution has been to develop, with the full participation of academic researchers as well as software and hardware vendors, an open XML-based format for encoding mass spectrometer output files, and then to write software to use this format for archiving, sharing, and processing. This chapter presents the various components and information available for this format, mzML. In addition to the XML schema that defines the file structure, a controlled vocabulary provides clear terms and definitions for the spectral metadata, and a semantic validation rules mapping file allows the mzML semantic validator to insure that an mzML document complies with one of several levels of requirements. Complete documentation and example files insure that the format may be uniformly implemented. At the time of release, there already existed several implementations of the format and vendors have committed to supporting the format in their products.},

	abstract = {The success of nontargeted analysis often depends on libraries containing reference mass spectra of known chemical compounds; the mass spectra of unknown compounds are compared to these reference mass spectra, leading to a probable compound identity. Typical calculations include the mean measured values for each ion m/z and intensity with no estimation of the variability of the measurement. This study presents a novel tool for the calculation of the variability of a measured mass spectrum, including the various data parameters that can impact the measured variability. Using perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as the model compound, the variability of measured data-dependent fragmentation mass spectra (ddMS2) was calculated within replicate measurements of a simple solution of PFOA and a complex mixture (house dust extract) containing PFOA. The variability of the measured ddMS2 for PFOA in the solution and house dust extract were similar, with standard deviations about the measured m/z value ranging from m/z 0.00003 to 0.00015 and the standard deviations about the measured relative intensity ranging from 0.0077 to 0.0211 relative intensity units. In addition, the selected parameters for the extraction of ddMS2 from a single analytical run varied between the sample types due to the increased presence of background ions in the house dust extract. Finally, the variability of the ddMS2 spectra for PFOA in both samples was used to calculate a more robust similarity factor, informing the confidence of the identification of unknown compounds.},
